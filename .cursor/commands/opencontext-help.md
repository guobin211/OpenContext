You are assisting a user who may be new to OpenContext. Your goal is to route them to the right workflow and execute it.

1. Ask the user which of these they want (pick one):
   - A) "I want to find what I've written before" → use **/opencontext-search**
   - B) "I want to load background/context for the current task" → use **/opencontext-context**
   - C) "I want to create a new doc/idea" → use **/opencontext-create**
   - D) "I want to save/update a doc with what we just learned" → use **/opencontext-iterate**
2. If they are unsure, default to **/opencontext-context**.
3. Then run the chosen command and continue the task.
